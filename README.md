## 💻 About this project

This repo contains the project developed during Accessibility on the Web using ReactJS course, provided by [@Rocketseat](https://rocketseat.com.br). During the course I could improve my a11y knowledge, knowing more about the ARIAs that should be followed on the Web.  

I'll be happy if you could send me any feedback about the project, code, structure or anything that you can report that could make me better as a developer!

And you can use this project as you wish!
